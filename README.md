<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project
This repository holds the code for my undergraduate senior thesis on differential privacy. The thesis
provides a rudimentary introduction to differential privacy as a framework for modern data privacy, using
the Harvard Computer Society email list archives as an investigative medium. The differentially private
analysis of this dataset includes but is not limited to: time series of list usage, email topic modeling,
and sentiment analysis. OpenDP's Python package for differential privacy is used extensively to execute
computations, and the API is evaluated as a standalone programming framework within itself. This repository
includes data wrangling scripts, as well as novel implementations of differentially private
LDA topic models and various graph-differential private algorithms. For security reasons, files
containing sensitive data have been omitted.
